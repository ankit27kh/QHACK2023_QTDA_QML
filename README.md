# Project Name: Quantum Machine Learning with Quantum Topological Data Analysis

## Team Name: AnK
### Team Members: Ankit Khandelwal

#### Main File: quantum_betti_calc.py
This file contains code to estimate Betti numbers using a quantum algorithm.
It uses Quantum Phase Estimation on the combinatorial laplacian for this purpose.

Plan is to provide experimental analysis on the algorithm
and use it in a quantum machine learning pipeline.

Data -> Simplicial complex ->
Quantum topological data analysis to get Betti numbers
-> Variational quantum algorithms for QML
